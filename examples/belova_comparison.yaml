description: |
  Compare resistive MHD and hybrid kinetic models for FRC merging.
  Based on Belova et al. 2025 methodology.

  This configuration runs both models with identical initial conditions
  and compares key diagnostics including:
    - Null point separation vs time
    - Reconnection rate evolution
    - Energy partition between thermal and magnetic
    - Total merge time

comparison:
  type: belova_merging
  cases:
    - examples/belova_case1_resistive.yaml
    - examples/belova_case1_hybrid.yaml

  metrics:
    - null_separation_vs_time
    - reconnection_rate_vs_time
    - energy_partition
    - merge_time

runtime:
  # Uses runtime from individual cases
  parallel: false  # Run sequentially for memory constraints
