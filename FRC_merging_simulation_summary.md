## 1. Simulation Approach

### 1.1 Numerical Code: HYM

- **3D nonlinear hybrid code** used for 2D FRC merging studies
- **Hybrid version:** Full-orbit kinetic description for thermal ions + fluid description for electrons
- **MHD version:** Single-fluid, resistive MHD for comparison
- Extensively benchmarked and validated for FRC modeling and NSTX(-U) experiments

### 1.2 Initial Conditions

- Generated by solving the **Grad-Shafranov equation** for a single FRC
- Assumed scalar plasma pressure and zero initial ion rotation
- Configuration mirror-flipped axially to create two-FRC symmetric setup
- Poloidal flux recalculated to avoid current density singularities at midplane

### 1.3 Boundary Conditions

| Simulation Type | Boundary Condition |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| Without compression | Perfectly conducting |
| With compression | Time-dependent Aφ at R = Rc |

### 1.4 Normalization

| Quantity | Normalization |
|----------|---------------|
| Pressure | B₀²/4π (B₀ = external field at separatrix) |
| Density | n₀ (O-point density, peak value at magnetic null) |
| Velocity | vA = B₀/√(4πn₀mᵢ) (Alfvén velocity) |
| Length | dᵢ (ion collisionless skin depth at n₀) |
| Time | 1/ωcᵢ |
| Alfvén time | tA = Rc/vA |

## 2. Simulation Cases and Results

### 2.1 Case 1: Large FRC Merging Without Compression

#### Initial Parameters
| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Kinetic parameter S* = Rs/dᵢ | 25.6 |
| Elongation E = Zs/Rs | 2.9 |

| Reynolds number Re = RcvA/ν | 1900 |
| Initial FRC separation ΔZ | 180 |
| Separatrix beta βs | 0.2 |

#### MHD Results (Fig. 1)
- Initial velocity: Vz = ±0.2vA
- **Outcome:** Partial merging → doublet configuration
- Final null separation: ΔZ ≈ 40
- Final elongation: E ~ 7
- Peak reconnection time: t ~ 5tA
- Peak pressure: p₀ = 0.54 (t=0) → 0.47 (t=20tA)

#### Hybrid Results (Fig. 2)
- Mirror field applied at t=0 (mirror ratio 1.5)
- **Outcome:** Partial merging → doublet FRC
- Final null separation: ΔZ ≈ 90 (larger than MHD)
- Final elongation: E ~ 6.5 (comparable to MHD)
- Toroidal spin-up: vφ ~ 0.1-0.2vA (due to resistive flux decay)

### 2.2 Case 2: Small FRC Merging Without Compression

#### Initial Parameters
| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Kinetic parameter S* | 20 |
| Elongation E | 1.5 |
| Normalized separatrix radius xs | 0.53 |
| Separatrix beta βs | 0.2 |
| Initial FRC separation ΔZ | ~75 |
| Initial velocity Vz | ±0.1vA |

#### MHD Results (Fig. 3)
- **Outcome:** Complete merging by t ~ 5tA
- Final elongation: E ~ 2.5
- Peak pressure: p₀ = 0.89 (t=0) → 0.64 (t=13.5tA)

#### Hybrid Results (Fig. 4)
- **Outcome:** Nearly complete merging by t ~ 6-7tA
- Final elongation: E ~ 2.5
- Separatrix beta increased: βs = 0.2 → 0.32
- Density change: within 20%
- S* remains approximately constant

### 2.3 Case 3: Effect of Initial Separation (Small FRC)

Same parameters as Case 2, varying initial separation:

| Initial ΔZ | Merging Time | Outcome |
|------------|--------------|---------|
| 75 | ~5-7tA | Complete merging |
| 110 | ~18tA | Complete merging |
| 125 | ~36tA | Complete merging |
| 185 | No merging | FRCs approach to ΔZ≈140, then drift apart |

**Key Finding:** 14% increase in separation (110→125) nearly doubled merging time.

### 2.4 Case 4: Compressional Merging (MHD)

#### Setup
- Same initial parameters as Case 1 (S*=25.6, E=2.9, xs=0.69)
- Compression profile: δAφ(z, R=Rc) ~ 0.5(1 - cos(πz/Zc))f(t)
- Time evolution: f(t) ~ (1 - cos(πt/T)), T = 19tA
- Final mirror field: 1.5B₀ at z = ±Zc

#### Results (Fig. 6)
| Time | Event |
|------|-------|
| t ≈ 10tA | FRCs accelerated to Vz ~ 0.4vA |
| t ≈ 11tA | FRCs crash, ΔZ drops sharply |
| t ~ 11-16tA | Partial merge, over-compression |
| Peak | Rs increases to ~29.4 (over-compressed) |
| Later | Rs drops to ~21, E increases to >7 |
| t = 22tA | Plasma ejection from x-points |
| Final | Complete single-null FRC, E ~ 5 |

- Peak pressure: p₀ = 0.54 (t=0) → 0.71 (t=38tA)

### 2.5 Case 5: Compressional Merging (Hybrid)

#### Results (Fig. 7)
- Global dynamics similar to MHD up to t ~ 15tA
- FRCs merge partially at t ~ 10-16tA
- **Key Differences from MHD:**
  - Reduced amplitude and frequency of axial oscillations
  - Transient antisymmetric toroidal field (quadrupole - Hall reconnection signature)
  - Thicker and shorter current layer
  - Order-of-magnitude lower radial outflow velocities
  - Much wider ion velocity profiles near reconnection region
  - Complete merging by t ~ 20-25tA

## 3. Parameter Sensitivity Summary

### 3.1 Factors Unfavorable for Merging

| Parameter | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| Larger βs (0.2 → 0.3) | FRCs bounce and drift apart |
| Larger xs (~0.7) | Incomplete merging, doublet formation |
| Larger E (>3) | Partial merging only |
| Larger initial separation | Longer merging time or no merging |

### 3.2 Physical Explanation

The sensitivity to parameters is due to **finite plasma density on open field lines**:
- Plasma between FRCs must be displaced for merging
- If energy required > energy released by merging + kinetic energy → merging prohibited
- Larger βs and separation increase plasma mass to displace
- Larger xs reduces gap (Rc - Rs), increasing effective viscosity

## 4. Key Quantitative Results

### 4.1 Elongation Changes After Merging

| Merging Type | Elongation Increase Factor |
|--------------|---------------------------|
| Partial (doublet) | ~2.3× |
| Complete | ~1.7× |

### 4.2 Kinetic vs MHD Comparison (S* ~ 20-25)

| Aspect | MHD | Hybrid |
|--------|-----|--------|
| Global dynamics | Similar | Similar |
| Reconnection type | Standard | Hall reconnection |
| Merging completeness | More complete | Less complete |
| Current layer | Thinner, longer | Thicker, shorter |
| Axial oscillations | Larger amplitude | Reduced (FLR viscosity) |
| Radial outflow | Higher | Order-of-magnitude lower |

### 4.3 Merging Timescales

| Condition | Timescale |
|-----------|-----------|
| Without compression (small FRC) | t ~ 5-7tA |
| With compression | t ~ 20-25tA (complete) |

## 5. Main Conclusions

1. **Compression is beneficial:** Increasing mirror magnetic field leads to faster and more complete FRC merging

2. **Without compression:** Merging is highly sensitive to βs, xs, and initial separation

3. **Doublet formation:** FRCs with E > 3 and xs ~ 0.7 merge partially, forming doublet configurations

4. **Tilt stability:** Merged FRCs have reduced S*/E ratio, beneficial for tilt mode stability

5. **Kinetic effects:**
   - Hall reconnection signatures in hybrid simulations
   - Increased effective viscosity from ion FLR effects
   - Reduced axial oscillations post-merging

6. **Energy conversion:** Merging converts FRC kinetic and magnetic energy into ion thermal energy
